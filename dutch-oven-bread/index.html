      <li>Add flours into water mixture, with a spatula. Work dough until doughy consistency with clean hands.</li>
      <li>Add starter dough to fresh dough, being careful as it may stick to the glass bowl.</li>
      <li>Knead dough for a few minutes, adding flour as needed to keep dough consistency.</li>
