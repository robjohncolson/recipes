    <p><strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART<sup>®</sup> (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?</strong></p>
    <p>VYVGART may cause serious side effects, including:</p>

                <p class="list"><strong>Infection.</strong> VYVGART may 
increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study, the most common 
infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More 
patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood 
cell counts, lymphocyte counts, and neutrophil counts. The majority of 
infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. 
Your health care provider should check you for infections before 
starting treatment, during treatment, and after treatment with VYVGART. 
Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. 
Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms 
of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever, chills, 
frequent and/or painful urination, cough, pain and blockage of nasal 
passages/sinus, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat, 
excess phlegm, nasal discharge, back pain, and/or chest pain.</p>

                <p class="list"><strong>Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions).</strong>
 VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such 
as rashes, swelling under the skin, and shortness of breath. In clinical
 studies, the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour
 to 3 weeks of administration, and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART
 discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during 
and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health 
care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.</p>
