   <b>Important</b>: Making soap requires handling potassium hydroxide lye, which is highly poisonous if ingested and may cause burns and irritation if touched or inhaled. Always keep lye away from pets and children, and wear gloves, safety glasses, and a mask while using it. For more on how to properly handle lye, check out this article.
